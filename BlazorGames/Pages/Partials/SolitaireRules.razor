<h2>Soltaire Rules</h2>

<h4>The Goal</h4>

<p>The goal of Klondike Solitaire is to build up each suit from the lowest card (Aces) to the highest card (Kings).</p>

<h4>How to Play</h4>

<p>Rules taken from <a href="https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/klondike/">Bicycle Cards</a></p>

<p>
    The four aces form the foundations. As it becomes available, each ace must be played to a row above the piles.
    Cards in the appropriate suit are then played on the aces in sequence - the two, then the three, and so on - as they become available.
</p>

<p>
    Any movable card may be placed on a card next-higher in rank if it is of opposite color.
    Example: A black five may be played on a red six. If more than one card is face up on a tableau pile, all such cards must be moved as a unit.
</p>

<p>
    When there is no face-up card left on a pile, the top face-down card is turned up and becomes available.
</p>

<p>
    Only a king may fill an open space in the layout.
    The player turns up cards from the top of the stock in groups of three,
    and the top card of the three may be used for building on the piles, if possible, played on a foundation.
    If a card is used in this manner, the card below it becomes available for play.
    If the up-card cannot be used, the one, two, or three cards of the group are placed face up on the waste pile,
    and the next group of three cards is turned up.
